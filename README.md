# Documentation of Full Stack open 
This repo serves as documentation for my progress on the Full Stack open "Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development" course. I plan to use the skills I've obtained from this course to enhance my web-application penetration testing abilities and create my own express application.

## Course Description
Learn React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript in one go! This course will introduce you to modern JavaScript-based web development. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.
